      <ExplorationHeader title="Question 1" description="
        How does economic status affect the frequency of live births per unit of population?
        While being of lower economic status should logically result in having a lower birth rate to compensate for the family's lack of purchasing power, this family decision can be hindered by one's lack of access to education.
        So we ask: are less economically advanced areas more conscious of having children?
        Or is it the other way around?
        Is financial status a factor in family planning in Filipino families in the first place?
        The answers to these questions will be visualized through the following joint plots.

          Along with this, we also rename each region so they can be more easily readable in the plot legend, as will be seen later.

          Improving on the scatter plot produces the following joint plot.
          From the image, one can observe that the birth rates of most Philippine municipalities cluster around the 1.0 to 1.5 births per capita range, and the poverty incidence mostly ranges from 0 to 40.
          Basic statistical testing using Pearson correlation coefficients gives values of p = 0.212 and r = -0.03, which shows an insignificant relationship between the two variables.
          However, we can improve this visualization further by grouping the municipalities according to the province they belong in.

          Using the number of municipalities in a province as the variable size of each marker, we are now able to better visualize the results above!
          From this figure, it is also more readily apparent that the BARMM region is an outlier, being away from the main cluster of datapoints.
          This can be attributed to the political instability and struggles in economic development in the Bangsamoro region, being only officially declared in 2018 and still constantly facing armed conflict in its short lifetime.
          This results in high poverty incidence in the region regardless of birth rate.

          As a matter of fact, if we omit this region from our computation, the plot would look a lot simpler.
          Testing this using Pearson correlation coefficient, this would yield p = 1.64e-17 and r = 0.216, implying a strong significant correlation.
          This gives us the insight that outside of BARMM's economic and political issues, the trend in the Philippines is that increasing povery incidence comes with increasing birth rate.
          This can be attributed to the country's poor sex education, which results in a lack of family planning in poorer Philippine areas.

          This can be attributed to a variety of factors, including poor education quality and poor public awareness about safety in sex.
          However, while this takeaway is useful insight for analyzing the current status of the nation, it is still important to realize that it is not proper to exclude any Philippine region out of the narrative, regardless of how problematic the region may be.

Before hospital medical care became more accessible in the Philippines, midwives were the go-to in delivering Filipino babies. Is that still the case today? In our data, delivery methods are divided into Health Professionals (hospitals), Traditional Birth Attendants (midwives or local clinics), Others, and Not Stated.

The regions are also well-represented across the plot. The regions in Mindanao are much more evident, which means that these areas still 'prefer' traditional birth attendants to health professionals. This 'preference' could be due to professional health care accessibility or culture; what we can say for sure is that there is still a significant number of Filipinos who use traditional birth attendants as a delivery method."

      <ExplorationItem
        title="Others and not stated"

The same reasoning (health care access, culture) can be applied, but it should be noted that the total count for this plot is much less than the former. This is a good thing since it is always safer to perform childbirth in a professional setting. The amount of data for deliveries by unstated means is too little to draw a conclusion."

Since it is binary, our two outcomes will be if it was delivered by a health professional or not. We use poverty incidence as the independent variable and `Count` as weight of our model. Based on the results, there is a <strong>statistically significant correlation between poverty incidence and the likelihood of having a health professional in childbirth</strong>. Since the coefficient for poverty incidence is negative (-0.0037) and the p-values < 0, we can conclude that as poverty incidence increases, the odds of a health professional childbirth decreases!
        Although, the low R-squared value (0.35) can suggest that there are likely other factors, too."
