        Raising a child in the Philippines is estimated to cost around 300,000
        pesos per year (Isla, 2023), a considerable expense for families in a
        developing nation with increasingly high inflation rates and cost of

        Using data science, we intend on analyzing economic indicators,
        geographical data, and maternal preferences to explore their combined
        impact on birth rates in the Philippines and promote family planning in
        highly impacted areas.
